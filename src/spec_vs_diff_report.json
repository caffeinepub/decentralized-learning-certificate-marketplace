  "summary": "Core frontend flows (II sign-in, portfolio/badge detail, employer verify, issuer mint UI) and a backend badge model with mint/verify/list methods were added. However, backend persistence/stable storage and the constraint to keep all backend logic in backend/main.mo (no extra backend modules) are not clearly satisfied, and several unrequested features (user profiles, secret-token admin initialization, extra endpoints) were introduced.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Badges are stored persistently in the single Motoko actor (survive canister upgrades using stable variables or upgrade hooks).",
      "reason": "The diff shows in-memory Maps and a mutable counter, but no stable variables and no preupgrade/postupgrade hooks to persist/restore state across upgrades.",

      "requirement": "Manage issuer permissions (who is allowed to mint), with safe defaults suitable for an MVP (e.g., canister controller/admin is initial issuer).",
      "reason": "Minting is restricted to 'admin' but the diff does not show initialization of an initial admin/issuer based on canister controller or any explicit issuer management methods (add/remove issuer). It relies on access-control initialization that is not defined in the shown file.",
